### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a physicist with a passion for creating physics simulations to help make complex concepts more accessible and engaging. When I'm not experimenting with simulations, I'm building websites as a full-stack developer, bringing ideas to life from frontend to backend.

- ⚛️ **Physics Simulations**: Exploring and demonstrating the beauty of physics through code.
- 💻 **Full-Stack Development**: Crafting responsive, intuitive, and dynamic websites.
- 🍲 **Personal Interests**: Yoga, cooking, and weightlifting!

### 🌱 Always Learning
I'm constantly expanding my skillset by diving into new frameworks, tools, and languages that help me grow both as a physicist and a developer.
