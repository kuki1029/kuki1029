### About Me
- I'm a physicist turned builder
- Worked with large teams on military software to small startups shipping new features everyday
- Worked on a real Quantum Computer
- Unconventional background brings some unique problem solving

  
### Tech Stack
- **React** TS: Worked on complex codebases
- **Node**: Used TCP + UDP to create a local chat app over secure connection
- **Python**: Building LLM apps
- **DevOps**: Docker + Kubernetes

But these are just technologies. I've learned these all myself. My architecture decisions and patterns transcend the choice of technology.

I am also learning how to better build distributed systems to support lower latency LLM apps and support millions of users.
